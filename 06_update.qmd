## Optional advanced: automatic deploys via GitHub

-   If this is the first time you're using git on your computer, do these things:

 - RStudio, Tools, Global Options, Git/SVN, Create SSH Key.

 - Copy the key over to your GitHub account Settings.

 - Back in RStudio, run these lines in the Shell/Terminal (also under Tools):

\`\`\`

git config \--global user.email "your\@email.com"

git config \--global user.name "username"

\`\`\`

-   Push your Quarto website project from RStudio to GitHub. Hint: Create a new repository on GitHub first.

-   Make your Netlify automatically update your website when you push to GitHub.

 - Netlify, Site settings, Build & deploy, Link repository.

 - Publish directory: \`\_site\`.

 - Test that it works by editing your website in RStudio, render, commit, push. Tip: for committing multiple files, \`git add .\` in the Terminal is convenient. It does the same thing as manually ticking everything in the Git tab.

## Bonus tasks

-   Get the person sitting next to you to edit your website.

 - RStudio - New Project - Version Control - URL is your GitHub repository.

 - Their Push will become a pull request.

 - You should merge the pull request to main. Your website should then update.

-   Fabricate a merge conflict. Solve it.
